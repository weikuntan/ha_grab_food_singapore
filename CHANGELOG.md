# Changelog

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-16

### Singapore port of ha_grab_food_thailand

- New domain `grab_food_sg` so it can coexist with the Thailand integration
- Region settings centralised in `const.py` (country `SG`, locale `en_SG`, currency `SGD`, `+65`)
- Price parsing handles `S$` / `SGD` / `$`
- Token instructions point to food.grab.com/sg
- API endpoints inherited from the Thailand version and not yet verified against Singapore
- Add `scripts/live_check.py` to test against Grab's real endpoints without Home Assistant
- Fix: order-status enum sensor no longer errors on a state Grab sends that we don't recognise; it shows `unknown` and exposes the raw value as the `raw_status` attribute

## [1.0.13] - 2026-06-28

### fix: move brand folder inside integration directory, resize icons to spec

Per HA 2026 brands proxy API, brand/ must live inside
custom_components/grab_food/ not the repo root.
Also resize icon.png to 256x256 RGBA and add @2x (512x512) variants.
logo.png resized to 256px wide with @2x variant.

## [1.0.10] - 2026-06-28

### fix: handle API redirect and non-JSON response; don't block setup on API errors

- api.py: add allow_redirects=False to detect Grab API endpoint changes;
  add _parse_json helper to raise a clear error on HTML/non-JSON responses
- coordinator.py: on GrabApiError return empty data instead of UpdateFailed
  so sensors stay available and setup succeeds even when API endpoint is wrong


## [1.0.9] - 2026-06-28

### fix: resolve 500 error caused by _reauth_entry_id property conflict

In newer HA versions ConfigFlow defines _reauth_entry_id as a read-only
property. Setting it in __init__ raised AttributeError which HA caught
and returned as a 500 on config flow load.

Fixes:
- Remove __init__ entirely; use self.source == SOURCE_REAUTH instead
  of custom _is_reauth flag, and self._get_reauth_entry() instead of
  manually tracking _reauth_entry_id
- Move DeviceInfo import in sensor.py from deprecated
  homeassistant.helpers.entity to homeassistant.helpers.device_registry


## [1.0.8] - 2026-06-28

### fix autorization and other bugs


## [1.0.7] - 2026-06-28

### fix: collapse config flow to single user step, fix 500 error

async_step_user now owns the token form directly with step_id='user'.
Previous design redirected user->token step which caused a step_id
mismatch that HA flow loader rejected with 500. Removed async_step_token
and ConfigFlowResult import; strings.json now has one step (user) with
the token fields, matching exactly what the code shows.


## [1.0.6] - 2026-06-28

### fix: remove phone/OTP flow, fix config flow 500 error

- Remove async_step_phone, async_step_otp and all OTP schemas — they
  caused a 500 because newer HA validates async_step_* methods against
  strings.json and those steps had no strings entries
- Add required 'user' step to strings.json (HA needs it as the flow
  entry-point declaration)
- Remove unused CONF_OTP constant from const.py
- Flow now goes directly user→token, no menu, no phone


## [1.0.5] - 2026-06-28

### fix autorization and other bugs


## [1.0.4] - 2026-06-28

### fix autorization and other bugs

### fix autorization and other bugs

### fix autorization and other

### fix request_otp and other

### fix request_otp and other


## [1.0.3] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- Manual token authentication — new "Paste token from browser / app" option in the setup menu bypasses the OTP flow entirely
- Auth method menu at setup start: choose between OTP or manual token
- Reauth now also offers both methods
- `invalid_token` error shown when a pasted token is rejected by Grab

### Fixed
- OTP flow diagnostic confirmed Grab API returns HTTP 400 for all request variations — the API requires an undocumented `clientId` from the official mobile app; the manual token path works around this
- Removed leftover `assert` in OTP verify step
